1. Flat (Exact Search)
Index Type: IndexFlat
Description:
Performs brute-force nearest neighbor search.
Exact results, but slow for large datasets.
All vectors are stored in memory, making it memory-intensive.
Variants:
IndexFlatL2: For L2 (Euclidean) distance.
IndexFlatIP: For Inner Product (dot product or cosine similarity when normalized).
2. IVF (Inverted File Index)
Index Type: IndexIVF
Description:
Suitable for large datasets.
Uses a clustering-based approach to divide the dataset into multiple "inverted lists" (clusters).
During search, only a subset of clusters are searched, making it faster.
Variants:
IndexIVFFlat: Stores exact vectors in each cluster.
IndexIVFPQ: Combines IVF with Product Quantization (PQ) for compression.
IndexIVFScalarQuantizer: Uses scalar quantization for compression.
3. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
Index Type: IndexHNSW
Description:
Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.
Uses a graph-based approach to build a navigable small-world graph for efficient searching.
Provides high search accuracy with faster query times compared to other ANN methods.
Variants:
IndexHNSWFlat: HNSW with Flat storage for exact vectors.
IndexHNSWPQ: HNSW with Product Quantization for compressed storage.
4. Product Quantization (PQ)
Index Type: IndexPQ
Description:
Highly efficient for memory usage and large-scale datasets.
Compresses vectors into smaller representations using product quantization.
Suitable for approximate search but sacrifices some accuracy.
Use Case:
If memory usage is a primary concern.
5. LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)
Index Type: IndexLSH
Description:
Hash-based indexing for approximate nearest neighbor search.
Works well for binary vectors or datasets where hash-based partitioning is efficient.
Less commonly used than other FAISS index types.
6. Scalar Quantization (SQ)
Index Type: IndexScalarQuantizer
Description:
Quantizes each dimension of the vectors using scalar quantization.
Reduces memory usage compared to exact methods.
7. Multi-Index Hashing
Index Type: IndexMultiHash
Description:
Uses multiple hash tables for approximate search.
Useful for datasets that benefit from hashing approaches.
8. Binary Index
Index Type: IndexBinary
Description:
Designed for binary vectors (e.g., vectors with only 0s and 1s).
Variants for both exact and approximate search.
Variants:
IndexBinaryFlat: Exact search for binary vectors.
IndexBinaryIVF: IVF-based approximate search for binary vectors.
9. Composite Indexes
Composite indexes allow combining different indexing methods for added flexibility.

9.1. IndexIDMap
Description:
Wraps around another index to associate each vector with a unique ID.
Useful for applications where you need to retrieve an identifier instead of just the vector.
9.2. IndexPreTransform
Description:
Applies pre-processing transformations (e.g., PCA or normalization) before indexing.
10. GPU-Compatible Indexes
Most of the above indexes can be accelerated on GPUs by using faiss.IndexGpu wrappers or creating the index on a GPU directly. For instance:

faiss.index_cpu_to_gpu(gpu_resource, index)
Comparison of Index Types
Index Type	Accuracy	Speed	Memory Usage	Use Case
IndexFlat	High	Slow	High	Small datasets, exact search.
IndexIVF	Medium	Fast	Medium	Large datasets, approximate search.
IndexPQ	Low	Fast	Very Low	Memory-constrained environments.
IndexHNSW	High	Fast	Medium	High accuracy, large datasets.
IndexBinary	Depends	Depends	Low	Binary vector datasets.
How to Choose an Index?
Small Datasets (Exact Search): Use IndexFlat.
Large Datasets:
Memory-sensitive: Use IndexPQ or IndexIVFPQ.
High accuracy: Use IndexHNSW.
Fast search with good accuracy: Use IndexIVF.
Binary Data: Use IndexBinaryFlat or IndexBinaryIVF
