1. 🧠 Natural Language to Log Query Translation
Use Case: Interact with massive transaction logs using plain English.

GenAI Role: Converts prompts into complex queries (PL/SQL, HiveQL, Spark SQL, etc.).

Example:
"Show failed transactions in the last 24 hours by region"
→ Generates optimized SQL/Hive/Spark query over log tables.

2. 📄 Log Summarization & Explanation
Use Case: Convert raw, verbose transaction logs into executive-friendly summaries.

GenAI Role: Reads rows of logs and generates concise, human-readable insights.

Example:
“2000 transactions processed in 3 regions. 2.1% failed due to network latency in APAC."
(From thousands of Oracle or Excel log rows)

3. 🕵️ Root Cause Analysis via LLM
Use Case: Understand systemic or repeated issues from log patterns.

GenAI Role: Detects and explains the "why" behind anomalies using causal reasoning across log entries.

Example:
"Why are transactions failing at midnight in Europe?"
→ GenAI correlates logs and reports batch job overlap or DB deadlocks.


5. 🗂️ Automated Log Categorization & Labeling
Use Case: Classify millions of logs (e.g., "fraud risk", "network error", "timeout").

GenAI Role: Uses language understanding to auto-tag transactions.

Example:
Tags logs as "authentication issue", "payment gateway failure", etc., using LLM categorization.


7. 💬 Conversational Log Inspector
Use Case: Interact with logs like chatting with a system admin.

GenAI Role: Agent-based chat interface to explore logs semantically.

Example:
"What’s the most common transaction failure reason in last 7 days?"
→ Answered conversationally with supporting stats.


8. 📊 Log-to-Insight Report Generation
Use Case: Automatically create summaries, graphs, and narratives from logs.

GenAI Role: Turns logs into daily/weekly reports (e.g., PDF, Excel).

Example:
Excel export with:

Charts of success/failure rate

Narrative like: “Transaction volume peaked at 10AM. Success rate dropped below 95% on April 15.”
