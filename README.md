class CrossEncoder(nn.Module):

Defines a new PyTorch neural network module called CrossEncoder.
Inherits from nn.Module, which is the base class for all PyTorch models.


def __init__(self, input_dim):

This is the constructor of the class, which initializes the model.
It takes input_dim as an argument, which specifies the number of input features.


super(CrossEncoder, self).__init__()

Calls the constructor of nn.Module to initialize it properly.
Ensures that PyTorchâ€™s internal mechanisms (like parameter tracking, model saving/loading) work correctly.

self.fc = nn.Sequential

nn.Sequential is used to stack multiple layers in a sequential manner.

nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),  # Reduce dimensions

A fully connected (FC) layer that transforms the input from input_dim to 128 hidden units.
Learns a weighted sum of input features to extract important patterns.

nn.ReLU(),

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used as an activation function.
It introduces non-linearity by keeping positive values as-is and setting negative values to 0.
Helps the model learn complex relationships.

nn.Linear(128, 1)  # Output relevance score

Another fully connected (FC) layer that maps the 128-dimensional hidden representation to a single output.
This single output represents a relevance score (e.g., how well the input text/query pair matches).

def forward(self, x):

Defines the forward pass (how the input flows through the network).

return self.fc(x)

Passes the input x through the fully connected network (self.fc).
Returns a single scalar score that represents the relevance between text and query.


You can replace input_dim with actual embeddings from a text encoder (like GTE, BERT, etc.).
